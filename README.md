This project is a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages blockchain technology to enhance online education platforms. The project provides a dual-purpose solution for course completion:

1. **🎟️ Cross-Course NFT Integration**: Students who complete a course are awarded a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT). These NFTs not only serve as proof of course completion but also can be used to unlock additional content in other courses on the platform.
  
2. **📄 Course Completion Certificates**: Upon successfully completing a course, students are issued a tamper-proof, verifiable certificate. This certificate can be stored on a decentralized network and retrieved by the student or any other verifier.

## Key Features

- **🏆 Mint NFTs for Course Completion**: When a student completes a course, they are awarded a unique NFT. This NFT contains metadata that represents the course and the student's achievement.

- **🔓 Unlock Course Content**: The NFT can be used to unlock content in other courses on the platform. This feature encourages students to engage in further learning by providing them with access to new material.

- **🔐 Issue Verifiable Certificates**: In addition to NFTs, students receive a digital certificate upon course completion. This certificate is stored securely and can be retrieved and verified by any party.

## Smart Contract Overview

### `💻 CourseNFT.sol`

This Solidity smart contract handles the minting of NFTs and the issuance of certificates.

### Contract Functions

1. **🎨 Minting NFTs**
   - **Function**: `mintNFT(address student, string memory uri)`
   - **Purpose**: Mints a unique NFT for the student upon course completion, with a specific URI pointing to metadata.

2. **📜 Issuing Certificates**
   - **Function**: `issueCertificate(uint256 courseId, address student, string memory certificateURI)`
   - **Purpose**: Issues a certificate to the student upon course completion, storing the certificate URI on-chain.

3. **🔓 Unlocking Course Content**
   - **Function**: `unlockCourse(uint256 courseId, uint256 tokenId)`
   - **Purpose**: Allows students to unlock content in other courses using their NFT.

4. **🛡️ Checking Course Unlock Status**
   - **Function**: `isCourseUnlocked(uint256 courseId, address user)`
   - **Purpose**: Checks if a course has been unlocked for a student.

5. **📂 Retrieving Certificate URI**
   - **Function**: `getCertificateURI(uint256 courseId)`
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves the URI of the certificate associated with a specific course.

### 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. **🔧 Prerequisites**:
   - Install [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for deploying the smart contract.
   - Have a wallet like MetaMask set up with some test ETH for transactions on a test network.

2. **⚙️ Deploying the Contract**:
   - Open Remix IDE and create a new file named `CourseCertificateNFT.sol`.
   - Copy the contract code into the file.
   - Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
   - Deploy the contract on the desired Ethereum test network (e.g., Rinkeby, Goerli) using your wallet.

3. **🛠️ Interacting with the Contract**:
   - Use the `mintNFT` function to mint NFTs upon course completion.
   - Use the `issueCertificate` function to issue certificates.
   - Use the `unlockCourse` function to unlock additional course content with the NFT.
   - Use the `getCertificateURI` function to retrieve a student’s certificate.

### 📝 Example Interactions

1. **🏅 Minting an NFT**:
   - Call `mintNFT` with the student’s address and the metadata URI.
   
2. **🎓 Issuing a Certificate**:
   - Call `issueCertificate` with the course ID, student’s address, and certificate URI.

3. **📚 Unlocking a Course**:
   - Call `unlockCourse` with the course ID and the NFT token ID.
   
4. **🔍 Retrieving a Certificate**:
   - Call `getCertificateURI` with the course ID to get the certificate URI.

### 💼 Use Cases

- **🎓 Online Education Platforms**: Incentivize continuous learning by rewarding students with NFTs that unlock new course content and provide verifiable certificates.
- **🏢 Employee Training Programs**: Track employee progress through NFTs and issue certificates for completed training modules.

### 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **🛒 Marketplace Integration**: Allow students to trade or sell their NFTs in a decentralized marketplace.
- **📑 Advanced Certification**: Implement multi-signature validation for certificates, allowing multiple parties to verify a student's achievement.
- **🎮 Gamification**: Introduce gamification elements where students can collect badges or special NFTs based on performance.
